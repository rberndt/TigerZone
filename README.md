## To Implement Team Client

Clone repository to local path. In command line, navigate to local path that repository resides, go into src folder, and build client using `g++ GameMain.cpp -o client.o`

Run client using `./client.o` and arguments of IP address of server, port you're currently connecting to, tournamnet password, team username, team password. All five arguments are separated by a single space.

`./client.o <server IP address> <port connecting to> <tournament password> <team username> <team password>`
